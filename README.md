# SnakeGame
_classic snake game gui, built with python with increasing speed._<br><br>
Use arrow keys to move Up, Down, Left & Right. If the snake touches itself or the boundary the game is over.
For the best experience please turn on your device audio as an audio clip plays when the snake successfully eats it food or when the snake dies.
There are two buttons on the scoring page for playing again and quitting the game.<br><br>
